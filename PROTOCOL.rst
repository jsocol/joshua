Joshua Protocols
================

There are multiple protocols within Joshua, server-to-server, client-to-server,
and public-to-server. All three operate over HTTP and use HTTP verbs.


Server-to-Server
================

The server-to-server, or P2P, protocol in Joshua describes how nodes talk to
each other to exchange data.


Client-to-Server
================

The client-to-server protocol describes how clients, such as web apps,
communicate with any given Joshua node.


Public-to-Server
================

This simple API describes how web browsers communicate with any Joshua node.
